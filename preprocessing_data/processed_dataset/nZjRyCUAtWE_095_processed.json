  "transcript": "one of my students wants to invite you to play basketball with him, but he is so cute, I want you guys to play basketball with my Son. I like that game very much, but the last time I made friends, it was a lifetime of playing like that, I don't see anything else, so I want that tomorrow, you will probably play basketball.
