HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
--------------------
1. Check basic_statistics.csv for overall dataset health
2. Review topic_statistics.csv to understand data distribution
3. Examine timing_anomalies.txt for potential data quality issues
4. Use visualizations to understand data patterns
5. Review word_frequency.csv for vocabulary insights

NEXT STEPS:
--------------------
1. Address any timing anomalies found
2. Consider data balancing if topics are heavily skewed
3. Use insights for model training strategy
4. Consider text preprocessing based on vocabulary analysis
